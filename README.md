Created a Q-learning-based strategy using a Reinforcement Learner-based approach.

• In the training phase, the learner is provided with a stock symbol and a time period. It uses this data to learn a strategy to make predictions about future price changes.

• In the testing phase, the learner will be provided a symbol and a date range. All learning is turned off during this phase.

• Results are compared by using different technical indicators.
